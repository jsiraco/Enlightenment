# Enlightenment Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an application that will allow a user to discover various kinds of art.
It is similar to pintrest in presentation, will allow a user to browse art, discover poetry, and save art to their own collection.
## Tools used 
JQuery, Bulma, the Met Museum API, and the Poemist API were all used, as well as local storage
## Future Development
For future development, mulitple APIs should be used to gether images, as having only one API limits the discovery possibility. Additional developments could be more search fields, an expended poem component, and customization options.
